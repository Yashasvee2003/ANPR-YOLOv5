# Automatic Number Plate Recognition

This project does ANPR and facial recognition using ultralytics YOLOv5 Object detection model. Inferencing is done on both images and video input. 

This can be used to design an end-to-end system that detects faces and number plates from real time traffic feed. The detected faces, number plates enclosed within bounding boxes can be stored in a NOSQL database along with a timestamp and periodically sent to the law enforcement authorities.




## Steps to Follow
- Open the given ipynb file in google colab

- Run it!

NOTE : we use detect-1.py which is a modified version of detect.py which crops out the images within bounding boxes.
